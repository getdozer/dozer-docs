# Adding Transformations

We now want to join the two datasets and perform an aggregations to determine the average fare of trips between zones. For this we will add a `sql` section to the `dozer-config.yaml` that looks like this:

```yaml
sql: |
    SELECT 
      PULocationID, DOLocationID, 
      pu_zones.Zone as PULocationName, 
      do_zones.Zone as DOLocationName, 
      AVG(fare_amount) as avg_amount
    INTO avg_fares
    FROM trips
    INNER JOIN zones pu_zones ON trips.PULocationID = pu_zones.LocationID
    INNER JOIN zones do_zones ON trips.DOLocationID = do_zones.LocationID
    GROUP BY PULocationID, DOLocationID;
```
::::note
The SQL you specify in the .yaml file does not run in the source database. Data is processed in real-time as it comes into Dozer by Dozer's internal streaming SQL engine.
::::

To expose the result of this query as an API we will also need to add an additional endpoint:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: avg_fares
    path: /avg_fares
    table_name: avg_fares
```

<Tabs groupId="tool">
  <TabItem value="live" label="Dozer Live">
Once you have done your chnages, you can click on the <div className="live-button">RELOAD ‚ü≥</div> button to re-trigger the ingestion from the CSV file and Supabase concurrently, and execute the above query in real-time.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Dozer CLI">

Now restart `dozer`, to re-trigger the ingestion from the CSV file and Supabase concurrently, and execute the above query in real-time.
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
