# Adding Transformations

We now want to join the two datasets and perform an aggregations to determine the average fare of trips between zones. For this we will add a `sql` section to the `dozer-config.yaml` that looks like this:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: actors
    table_name: actor
    connection: pagila_conn
    columns:
      - actor_id
      - first_name
      - last_name
  - name: films
    table_name: film
    connection: pagila_conn
    columns:
      - film_id
      - title
      - rental_rate
  - name: film_actors
    table_name: film_actor
    connection: pagila_conn
    columns:
      - actor_id
      - film_id

sql:  |
  SELECT a.first_name AS actor_first_name, 
         a.last_name AS actor_last_name, 
         f.title AS film_title, 
         f.rental_rate
  into actor_films
  FROM actors a
  JOIN film_actors fa ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
  JOIN films f ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
  WHERE f.rental_rate > 3;
```
::::note
The SQL you specify in the .yaml file does not run in the source database. Data is processed in real-time as it comes into Dozer by Dozer's internal streaming SQL engine.
::::
Here we used `actors`, `films` and `film_actors` as sources and joined them to create a new table `actor_films`. We also filtered the data to only include films with a rental rate greater than 3. 

This new table would replicated into the sink database.
```yaml
sinks:
  - table_name: actor_films
    config: !Dummy
```


Now restart `dozer`, to re-trigger the Snapshotting and Replication process. 

```bash
dozer run
```
