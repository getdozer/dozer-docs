# Adding Transformations

We now want to join few tables together. For this we will add a `sql` section to the `dozer-config.yaml` that looks like this:

```yaml
sql: |
  SELECT 
    rental.rental_id, 
    CONCAT(customer.first_name, ' ', customer.last_name) AS customer, 
    film.title 
  INTO joined_rental 
  FROM rental 
  INNER JOIN customer ON rental.customer_id = customer.customer_id 
  INNER JOIN film ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id;
```

::::note
The SQL you specify in the .yaml file does not run in the source database. Data is processed in real-time as it comes into Dozer by Dozer's internal streaming SQL engine.
::::

To expose the result of this query as an API we will also need to add an additional endpoint:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: joined_rental
    table_name: joined_rental
    path: /joined_rental
```


Now we have to build dozer again.

```bash
dozer build
```

To deploy this updated with transformation, you have to deploy it again.

```bash
dozer cloud deploy
```
