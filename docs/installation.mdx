This guide will walk you through the steps to install Dozer.



## Ubuntu (20.04 and above)

### Installing Prerequisites
Ubuntu 20.04 ships with protobuf-compiler v3.6.1.3, which isn't compatible with Dozer. Upgrade to a newer version using:


```bash
curl -sLO https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v22.2/protoc-22.2-linux-x86_64.zip
unzip protoc-22.2-linux-x86_64.zip -d $HOME/.local
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
```


You also need to install few other packages in Ubuntu.
```bash
sudo apt install openssl libssl-dev clang zlib1g-dev g++ cmake
```


### Installing Dozer





## Building from Source

::::note
Ensure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/downloads/), [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), [git](https://git-scm.com/) and other pre-requisites are set up on your system.

### Steps for installation

1. Clone Dozer from the GitHub repository recursively to include the submodules.
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/getdozer/dozer
cd dozer
```
2. Use cargo to build/install Dozer.
```bash
cargo install --path dozer-cli --locked
```
