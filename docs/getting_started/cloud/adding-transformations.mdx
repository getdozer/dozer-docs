# Adding Transformations

We now want to do some calculations on the data such as MIN, MAX and AVG. For this we will add a `sql` section to the `dozer-config.yaml` that looks like this:

```yaml
sql: |
  -- Ticker Analysis
  SELECT Ticker, AVG(Close) AS average_close_price, SUM(Volume) AS total_volume
  INTO ticker_analysis
  FROM stocks
  WHERE Date >= '2025-01-01' AND Date < '2025-02-01'
  GROUP BY Ticker;

  -- Daily Analysis
  SELECT Date, AVG(Close) AS average_close_price, SUM(Volume) AS total_volume
  INTO daily_analysis
  FROM stocks
  GROUP BY Date;

  -- Highest Daily Close Price
  SELECT Date, MAX(Close) AS highest_close_price
  INTO highest_daily_close
  FROM stocks
  GROUP BY Date;

  -- Lowest Daily Close Price
  SELECT Date, MIN(Close) AS lowest_close_price
  INTO lowest_daily_close
  FROM stocks
  GROUP BY Date;
```

::::note
The SQL you specify in the .yaml file does not run in the source database. Data is processed in real-time as it comes into Dozer by Dozer's internal streaming SQL engine.
::::

To expose the result of this query as an API we will also need to add an additional endpoint:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: ticker_analysis
    path: /analysis/ticker
    table_name: ticker_analysis

  - name: daily_analysis
    path: /analysis/daily
    table_name: daily_analysis

  - name: highest_daily_close
    path: /analysis/highest_daily_close
```


Now we have to build dozer again.

```bash
dozer build
```

To deploy this updated with transformation, you have to deploy it again.

```bash
dozer cloud deploy
```
