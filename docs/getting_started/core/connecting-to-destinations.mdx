# Connecting to the Sink Database

The following sections describe how to connect to the destination databases. Previously, we were transfering data to a demo sink, but now we will transfer data to a real sink.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use Aerospike.

## Connecting to Aerospike

### Pre-requisites

Make sure you have Aerospike is installed and running. If not, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.aerospike.com/docs/operations/install/). Or you can use the [Aerospike docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/aerospike) as shown below.

```bash
docker pull aerospike
```

We now want to connect to Aerospike using Dozer to replicate the data from our sources. For this, we will add details about the Aerospike sink to the `config.yaml` file.

```yaml
connections:
  - config: !Aerospike
      namespace: test
      sets: []
      hosts: localhost:3000
    name: sink_connection
sinks:
  - table_name: <source table>
    config: !Aerospike
      connection: sink_connection
      namespace: test
      set_name: <set name> 
```
