# ðŸ“š Overview

Dozer is a Real-Time SQL Engine that connects to any of your data sources, transforms and stores the data in an embedded cache.

**Core Features**

* Simple to Use
Dozer instantly generates fully indexed gRPC and REST APIs automatically. All you need is to configure a YAML file with your data source configuration and the APIs you want to deploy. 

* Combine data from multiple sources
Dozer can in real-time join data coming from multiple data sources powering advanced use cases. This can be done using the standard JOIN operator in SQL.

* Data API Endpoints
