# Connecting to Sources


After logging into Dozer Cloud in CLI. We will setup our sample database for this guide. We will be a stock monthly data for this example.

## Pre-requisites

1. Setup your AWS Account
2. Data:
```bash
    curl -O https://dozer-samples.s3.amazonaws.com/stock_data_monthly_small/stock_data_monthly.csv
    aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <yourbucketname> --region ap-southeast-1
    aws s3 cp stocks_data_monthly s3://yourbucketname/stocks_data_monthly_small/
```


## Sourcing data from AWS S3

Open a new file `dozer-config.yaml` and add the following configuration section:
```yaml
version: 1
app_name: s3-example
connections:
  - config: !S3Storage
      details:
        access_key_id: "{{ AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}"
        secret_access_key: "{{ AWS_SECRET_KEY}}"
        region: "{{ AWS_REGION_S3}}"
        bucket_name: "{{ AWS_BUCKET_NAME}}"
      tables:
        - !Table
          name: stocks
          config: !CSV
            path: stock_data_monthly_small/ # path to files or folder inside a bucket
            extension: .csv
    name: s3
endpoints:
- name: stocks
  table_name: stocks
  path: /stocks
```


## Validating the Sources

Run the following command to validate the sources:

```bash
dozer build
```

This will create a `dozer.lock` file in the current directory.

## Deploying on cloud

To deploy the sample on the cloud, run the following command:
