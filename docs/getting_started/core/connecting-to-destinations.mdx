# Connecting to the Sink Database

In the previous sections, we have seen how to connect to the source databases. In this section, we will go through how to connect to the destination databases. Previously, we were transfering data to a demo sink, but now we will transfer data to a real sink.

For this purpose, we will be using Aerospike as the sink database. However, you can use any of the supported sinks, which you can find [here](/category/sinks).

[Aerospike](https://aerospike.com/) is a distributed, scalable NoSQL database that is optimized for flash storage and solid-state drives. It is a key-value store that is designed to be fast and reliable.

## Connecting to Aerospike

### Pre-requisites

Make sure you have Aerospike is installed and running. If not, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.aerospike.com/docs/operations/install/). Or you can use the [Aerospike docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/aerospike) as shown below.

```bash
docker pull aerospike
```

We now want to connect to Aerospike using Dozer to replicate the data from our sources. For this, we will add details about the Aerospike sink to the `config.yaml` file.

```yaml
connections:
  - config: !Aerospike
      namespace: test
      sets: []
      hosts: localhost:3000
    name: sink_connection
sinks:
  - table_name: <source table>
    config: !Aerospike
      connection: sink_connection
      namespace: test
      set_name: <set name> 
```


The `dozer-config.yaml` file should look like this:

```yaml
version: 1
app_name: simple-pg-sample
connections:
  - name: pagila_conn
    config: !Postgres
      user: postgres
      password: postgres
      host: localhost
      port: 5433
      database: pagila
  
  - config: !Aerospike
      namespace: test
      sets: []
      hosts: localhost:3000
    name: sink_connection

sources:
  - name: films
    table_name: film
    connection: pagila_conn
    columns:
      - film_id
      - title
      - rental_rate

sinks:
  - table_name: films
    config: !Aerospike
      connection: sink_connection
      namespace: test
      set_name: films
```

Now start the replication by running the following command:

```bash
dozer run --enable-progress
```
You should see a screen like the following
```bash
 INFO Source: Initializing input schema: film
+-------------+---------+----------+-------+

| title       | String  | false    | false |

| rental_rate | Decimal | false    | false |

 INFO Snapshotting for connection pagila_conn took 6.535752ms    
 ```

### Replication

Now that we have the Aerospike sink set up, we can start the replication process. We will update `film` table in the source database and see if the changes are reflected in the sink database.

```sql
-- Increase the price of all films by 10%
UPDATE film
SET rental_rate = rental_rate * 1.1;

-- Mark all films released before 2005 as old
UPDATE film
SET release_year = 'Old'
WHERE release_year < 2005;

-- Set the rental duration of all films to 7 days
UPDATE film
SET rental_duration = 7;

-- Increase the replacement cost of all films by 5
UPDATE film
SET replacement_cost = replacement_cost + 5;
```

After running the above sql queries, you should see the changes reflected in the Aerospike sink.

```bash
 INFO NOTICE: publication "dozer_publication_pagila_conn" does not exist, skipping    
 INFO Snapshotting for connection pagila_conn took 6.535752ms    
 INFO [pagila_conn] Starting Replication: 0/24F7998, "dozer_publication_pagila_conn"

```
