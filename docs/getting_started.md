# Getting Started

Dozer is a Data Product backend that embeds a streaming SQL engine, a low-latency data cache and generates gRPC and REST APIs that can be easily integrated in frontend applications.

Dozer is available in two flavours: an Open Source Core version and a Cloud version. In these tutorial we will show you how to build and deploy a Dozer application step by step.
